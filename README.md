# Machine Learning with Python

Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms using Scikit-learn and xgboost, and [mlxtend](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) Python libraries. A large fraction of the code examples is based on [Sebastian Raschka's Python Machine Learning Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition).
